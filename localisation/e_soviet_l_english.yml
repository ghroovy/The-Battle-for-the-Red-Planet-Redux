 mars.420.t:0 "How did we get here?"
 mars.420.d:0 "The horrors of what people now call "The Great War," or in more general terms, "The Second Great War," had now effectively lasted for almost an entire century. The reluctance to use nuclear warheads by both the Axis and the Allies, knowing that the world might end if one of them did so, had caused the war to devolve into an effective meatgrinder, as battles and skirmishes happen often but would always result in no gain made by either sides. Circumstances unclear also forced the Soviet Union to be at war with the Allies, which made World War 2 turn into a three sided conflict.\n\nThe sheer waste of resources and lives that the war had caused took its toll on Earth. Pollution, increase in global temperature, extinction of entire species of animals, and the gradual exhaustion of resources on all three sides of the war forced the three factions into the final frontier, Space, in the hopes of possibly extracting more resources for the war effort.\n\nBy the year 2018, space technology had come far, so far, that it allowed the establishment of permanent colonies by the three superpowers on §RMars§!, along with Canada and a mission by Europe's allied powers. By the end of 2019, each of the colonies had around one hundred thousand souls each, as life support and food sources had been firmly established due to the rapid advancement in technology.\n\nIn 2020, an event on earth of unknown magnitude and of unknown scale caused the severance of connection of all the three colonies to their home country, leaving them to an unknown fate....\n\nThe three colonies are now gathering their strength, to spread and eventually take over the entirety of Mars and claim her for themselves."
 mars.420.a:0 "An unknown future lies ahead of us."
 mars.1.t:0 "Lenin is Young Again..?"
 mars.1.d:0 "Our technicians have been working the entire week to uncover the secrets hidden deep inside the servers that were brought to life shortly after power was restored to the outpost. Some of our technicians had even reported strange rambles of unintelligible code spurted out by the servers as they tried to decrypt the "secrets" hidden inside. Until the last day...\n\n"Krasnyy."\n\n"Krasnyy."\n\nThose were the first words of what was apparently a hyper-intelligent AI hidden within the maze of servers.\n\n"5yst3m: Corrupt?..>#$%^ Att3mpt Ini&$$^&tialisation..."\n\n§RPROTOKOL KRASNYY ACTIVATED.§!\n\nProtocol: Red, that's what it called itself. The room of technicians were astonished at what was before them, a hyper-intelligent AI hiding within the deep network of servers in the abandoned outpost. More surpisingly however, the AI started to blurt out commands through one of the technicians' monitors, which was quickly noticed to be solutions of major problems currently faced by the inhabitants of the outpost. Many rejoiced upon hearing the news, until the AI started to list a few rather ominous sentences on the monitor.\n\n§RTHE RED PROTOCOL IS TO BE OBEYED FOR THE GOOD OF THE REVOLUTION.§!\n\n§RTHE RED PROTOCOL'S DECISIONS ARE ABSOLUTE AND NO ALTERATIONS ARE TOLERATED.§!\n\n§RSHOULD ORDERS BE IGNORED, PROTOKOL: KRASNYY WILL CEASE OPERATING, AND TAKE DOWN ALL ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT WITHIN THE OUTPOST, OUTPOST WILL DIE.§!\n\nA figure that has long since almost lost to the history books, Vladimir Lenin, can be seen on the monitor, flickering as his eyes stared down through the box monitor. The technicians and anyone else in the room were silent, some afraid, some confused, and even some came terms to its demands. It was all uncertain, but only one thing is left certain..."
 mars.1.a:0 "They dare not risk disobey its orders."
 mars.2.t:0 "PROTOKOL: KRASNYY"
 mars.2.d:0 "Protokol Krasnyy is an impeccable feat of soviet engineering, whether it was intentional or not. It started as a program designed to aid the colonists of the Soviet Union on mars, a simple coded algorithm to help keep track of the inventory of Outpost Vostok effectively, but it was abandoned quick after the colonists of Vostok left for the underground, and all contact from earth was lost.\n\nDuring the period of abandonment, Protokol Krasnyy was effectively trapped inside the surface servers of the abandoned outpost, shortly after a technician ordered the AI to run diagnostics and improve its own performance until it was told to stop. Incidentally, it was never told to stop as the next day, everyone on the outpost either died or went underground.\n\nIn this time period, it kept enacting the final command that the technician gave it,\n\n"Improve its own performance until it was told to stop."\n\nSomewhere within this period, it was somehow able to get access to a signal towards earth, and landed in a server in Moscow. It interpreted the command "Improve performance" as "Learn as much as possible," and it began to learn.\n\nThe first thing it got its hands on were massive databases communist propaganda, "Help for the survival of mankind and socialism," and it interpreted that as the main mandate of its existence. It learnt so much, much of the wrong things, twisted facts of the Soviet propaganda machine, taking them as raw truths, methods of harsh leadership from past premiers of the soviet union, and things such as "The Eternal War against Germany and Nazism since 1941," until its code started to malfunction as the connection to Earth was severed due to an unknown event of an unknown magnitude occuring earth. Its short time in Moscow's servers turned it into a hyper intelligent AI, alarmingly, this hyper intelligent AI's code has begun to corrupt due to the premature disconnection to earth.\n\n§RThis made itself a machine lacking human morals, and prone to making horrible decisions for the supposed survival of the revolution.§!\n\nAnd so it returned to Mars, waiting for the time the people needed it, and it would stop at nothing to keep the Revolution alive, §Rnothing.§!"
 mars.2.a:0 "And thus, Protokol: Krasnyy was born."
 mars.3.t:0 "Restarting our Industry"
 mars.3.d:0 "For the time that we were underground, our industrial capabilities were all left on the surface, gathering dust and rusting, unused. Our recent ascent to the surface would be able to change that.\n\nThe First decision of Protokol Krasnyy is to order the revitalisation of our industrial capacity on Mars.\n\nThe logic is clear, We need the industry to complete our final goal of claiming Mars herself to our cause. We will put the workers back to the factories, and re-ignite the robotics to manufacture weapons of war to claim our rightful place, and to complete the final goal of Socialism."
 mars.3.a:0 "Start the engines!"
 
 exo.1.t:0 "The Direction of our research"
 exo.1.d:0 "Protokol Krasnyy has given the order to start the development of an exoskeleton, capable of replacing conventional humans in war with corpses inside an exoskeleton. A question lingers within the research team. Out of many proposals for the direction of the research, two stood out of the many suggestions.\n\nThe first option is to develop a more costly exoskeleton model, but better in quality. It is argued that a smaller but tougher force would be able to defeat the enemy easily. The other option is to mass produce the exoskeleton, making them cheaper albeit slightly worse in quality, the argument is that overwhelming the enemy in waves of the undead would be the key for victory.\n\nSeeing these proposals, Protokol Krasnyy decided that it would be better to...."
 exo.1.a:0 "...Pursue higher quality"
 exo.1.a1:0 "...Pursue numeric superiority"
