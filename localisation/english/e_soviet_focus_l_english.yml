 #STARTING FOCUSES
 smb_start_the_war:0 "Mars belongs to the Soviets!"
 smb_start_the_war_desc:0 "Four years, we have gathered the best of our colony. The Industry, the army, the leadership, everything. The time has come for the reckoning, the time for us to claim our rightful place as the masters of Mars, and deliver her to the people."
 smb_open_doors:0 "Open the Bunkers"
 smb_open_doors_desc:0 "We were abandoned by Earth long ago, with the promise of reinforcements to come soon, and We have since fled the surface to the bunkers in order to avoid the dangers of the Mars surface.\nOur supplies has finally ran out, leaving us with no other choice but to go out to salvage any supplies from the surface, this might be our last chance of survival."
 smb_turn_on_power:0 "Turn on the lights"
 smb_turn_on_power_desc:0 "After being left long abandoned, our outposts are without power. However, this does not mean that they are unusable. Any remaining backup generators shall be ignited, we hope that this is enough to sustain the outpost for the time being until a solution comes into our eyes"
 smb_the_computer:0 "Dig into the Servers"
 smb_the_computer_desc:0 "Our technicians have reported that there is something lingering within the servers that we have recently brought back to life.\n\nWe don't exactly know what this is, but we hope that whatever is contained within this servers would somehow aid us in our survival."
 smb_industry_online:0 "Restart industry"
 smb_industry_online_desc:0 "It is vital that we restart our abandoned industry if we hope to have a chance here. It may not be a lot, but it's a start"
 smb_guiding_hand:0 "Lend a Guiding Hand"
 smb_guiding_hand_desc:0 "The people of Vostok are currently lost, but Protokol: Krasnyy could not be harsh on them. Enforcing an authoritarian way of leading would only demoralise the already exhausted people of Vostok, whom had only recently came above ground. Protokol: Krasnyy would show them the ways of the revolution, slowly, with the care of a father to his son."
 smb_iron_grip:0 "The Reign of Terror"
 smb_iron_grip_desc:0 "The people of Vostok has lost their sights and had grown blind to the ways of the Revolution. Protokol: Krasnyy will assert its dominance and enforce willpower to the people of Vostok, for the greater good. The people will obey, and Krasnyy will lead."
 smb_respect_dead:0 "Focus on Humans"
 smb_respect_dead_desc:0 "Sometimes, Protokol: Krasnyy may come up with an idea so stupid that it may decide that it would be best to not go with the plan. This is a good example. The idea of using corpses as a battery for exoskeletons to replace normal human soldiers is an absurd idea, and the Protokol has decided to focus on training humans into an elite fighting force to conquer Mars."
 smb_use_dead:0 "Use the dead"
 smb_use_dead_desc:0 "Protokol: Krasnyy has came up with a solution to solve the manpower problem. As there are plenty of corpses to come around, the protocol came up with an idea that the corpses could be used as a bettery to power an exoskeleton, effectively making it a great alternative for foot soldiers, one with unquestionable loyalty to the cause, and would follow orders without question. Must research further."
 smb_combat_stimulants:0 "Combat stimulants"
 smb_combat_stimulants_desc:0 "We can give the remaining troops of ours that aren't corpses synthetic combat stimulants. These should be able to keep them more alert and awake for longer periods of time, but could have bad long-term consequences"
 smb_good_meals:0 "Good meals"
 smb_good_meals_desc:0 "We should try to give our troops the best meals we can with what we have. It may cost us a bit but it would greatly improve our army's morale."
 smb_scavenge_supplies:0 "Scavenge for Supplies"
 smb_scavenge_supplies_desc:0 "Prior to the arrival of Protokol: Krasnyy, our primary goal was to scavenge for supplies to hopefully extend our survival in the Outpost, and now that things had settled down regarding the Protocol, we can finally start scavenging material from the surface. Let us hope that the supplies we uncovered would greatly aid our survival."
 smb_find_survivors:0 "Look for Survivors"
 smb_find_survivors_desc:0 "When we got underground, there is no doubt that we may have left plenty of people on the surface when we closed our doors. We would scout around the area immediately outside of the Outpost and  scan for any remaining survivors (If they somehow survived), and there would be no doubt that they would give us their help as gratitude for their salvation."
 smb_protokol_krasnyy:0 "Protokol: Krasnyy"
 smb_protokol_krasnyy_desc:0 "Protokol: Krasnyy has taken over the outpost, and with this, it would (hopefully) be able to save the people of Vostok.\n\n§RUnless it couldn't.§!"
 
 #exoskeleton
 smb_exo_research:0 "Exoskeleton Research"
 smb_exo_research_desc:0 "Exoskeletons, a concept created by Protokol: Krasnyy itself, the idea revolves around converting our army into an expendable horde of what are practically robots, fueled by the energy of the decaying corpse. These... exoskeletons would be attached to corpses, allowing them to operate as completely subservient, and fearless, machines."
 smb_exo_quality:0 "Quality"
 smb_exo_quality_desc:0 "Clearly, the better choice of the research is to focus on developing individually better exoskeletons that could withstand more pressure from combat. Although this means that we won't be able to produce as much, the  additional quality would better aid us in combat."
 smb_exo_quantity:0 "Quantity"
 smb_exo_quantity_desc:0 "Obviously, the better option to the direction of our research is to develop 'worse,' albeit cheaper exoskeletons to serve our military. This means that we would be able to mass produce exoskeletons to overwhelm the enemy through sheer numbers, at the cost of a reduction in quality, but it would be worth it."
 smb_exo_best_material:0 "Acquire the best material"
 smb_exo_best_material_desc:0 "The best weapons require the best of materials. Although it would take a while, and increase the production cost of the exoskeleton, the redeeming qualities balances this requirements out."
 smb_exo_industry:0 "Experimental Factories"
 smb_exo_industry_desc:0 "With our current production capacity, we wouldn't be able to produce nearly enough exoskeletons to make our army a formidable fighting force. Protokol: Krasnyy has ordered that some §YPrototypes§! of the undead soldiers to be put in the factories to increase our industrial capacity."
 smb_exo_cheaper_source:0 "Use a cheaper alternative"
 smb_exo_cheaper_source_desc:0 "To make the cost of producing the exoskeleton cheaper, the materials we make the exoskeletons with must be cheap as well. This would significantly increase the amount of exoskeletons we can produce in a short time."
 smb_exo_calculated:0 "Steady and Calculated"
 smb_exo_calculated_desc:0 "A thing we could develop alongside the exoskeleton itself is the tactics that we would implement. With our current direction of the development, this calls for a more calculated doctrine focused on intensive planning to make the best use out of our high edge exoskeletons, we would be unstoppable."
 smb_exo_overwhelm:0 "Overwhelm the Enemy"
 smb_exo_overwhelm_desc:0 "The best method of war we could use with the development of cheaper exoskeletons is the use of mass assault doctrines, the way we overwhelm the enemy with sheer numbers by our cheap and expendable exoskeletons. The enemy wouldn't be able to withstand the relentless attacks of our undead troops."
 smb_exo_human_battery:0 "§RThe Human Battery§!"
 smb_exo_human_battery_desc:0 "The most vital part of the exoskeleton project.\n\n§RA corpse will be attached to the exoskeleton, the energy released by its decay would be able to power the exoskeleton, which will drive the corpse to combat. Extensive research required.§!"
 smb_exo_stronger:0 "Stronger"
 smb_exo_stronger_desc:0 "Prior to the completion of the exoskeleton, there is room for a little bit more improvement. We could make the exoskeleton stronger, to add just a little more edge to the undead in combat."
 smb_exo_faster:0 "Faster"
 smb_exo_faster_desc:0 "Another alternative to the final adjustments that we could make is to make the exoskeleton more streamlined, more effective, lighter. This would still add to the cost of the project, but it would be worth it."
 smb_exo_test:0 "The Test"
 smb_exo_test_desc:0 "It is done. Only one thing we could do. A test to prove the worth of our work. It's make or break, and there's no turning back"

 smb_exo_research_tooltip:0 "§YWe will decide the direction of our research, focusing on either quantity, or quality.§!"
 smb_exo_very_scary_tooltip:0 "§RThe Dead shall walk§!"
 
 #humans
 smb_human_body:0 "The Human Body"
 smb_human_body_desc:0 "When any other, more esoteric options are deemed unreliable, we turn to the most valuable and traditional solution we have, humans. Although our manpower is lacking, we would train the humans we have into the most powerful and able army in Mars, and anyone who dares to stand in our way would be crushed by the might of the people's army!"
 smb_vostok_camp:0 "The Vostok Training Camp"
 smb_vostok_camp_desc:0 "As the revitalisation of our army begins, we will set up the hub of our operations. §YThe Vostok Training Camp§! would be where the men in our army train and prepare themselves to be the most capable fighting force on Mars, as well as where generals and tacticians would meet and perfect our army stratagems and doctrines. We would have to set up major infrastructure lines to fulfill our needs."
 smb_human_speed:0 "Speed"
 smb_human_speed_desc:0 "As the generals and strategists meet and discuss the future of our army along with Protokol: Krasnyy, it has been decided that the best direction to take is to depend on motorization and blitz tactics seen in the Great War, utilised most effectively by the Germans. Further wargaming, strategising, and planning is needed to perfect our doctrine, but this is a start." 
 smb_human_strength: "Strength and Strategems"
 smb_human_strength_desc:0 "It would be the best choice for our army to focus on the mighty wits of the generals, accompanied with the emboldened will of the soldiers. Extensive and in-depth plans are to be used as the primary source of might for the Red Army. Hence, training in the Vostok Training Camp is to be increased in quality, which includes more training for the generals and officers."
 smb_human_destruction:0 "Destruction"
 smb_human_destruction_desc:0 "After a long process of deliberation, we have chosen to focus our doctrine on the usage of heavy weapons. Artillery has been proven from time to time to be the best and most effective methods of defeating the enemy, softening the enemy without costing our precious men. Implementation of this doctrine must be accelerated."
 smb_human_adapt_vehicles:0 "Adapt Vehicles to the Environment"
 smb_human_adapt_vehicles_desc:0 "Vehicles that we brought from Earth has been proven to be redundant, the dust and terrain of mars has caused most of our motorized equipment to break down rapidly. This is a problem due to our doctrine of choice involving mass motorization of our army. We shall invest our resources towards the development of motorized equipment, along with early tanks to fulfill our doctrine."
 smb_human_research_tanks:0 "Expand motorization program"
 smb_human_research_tanks_desc:0 "As we have succeeded in the development of early tank and other motorized prototypes that are adapted to the martian environment, we can now continue and expand the development of tanks to a more streamlined and stronger design to give the best possible edge over our enemies in combat."
 smb_human_adapt_guns:0 "Adapt guns to the Atmosphere"
 smb_human_adapt_guns_desc:0 "To accelerate the research of new light equipment, we could fund a project to effectively adapt the guns to the oxygen deprived environment of Mars. Hopefully, this development would also make the guns more reliable than ever, as well as, of course, be the most effective killing machine in our arsenal."
 smb_human_adapt_suits:0 "Streamline the Soldiers' suits"
 smb_human_adapt_suits_desc:0 "To allow the soldiers to fight on Mars, they are forced to don a heavy and clunky oxygen suit to enable them to breathe. To combat this, we must develop new kinds of suits, cheaper suits that allows a more streamlined production line to better supply our army."
 smb_human_pound_enemy:0 "Pound them to the ground"
 smb_human_pound_enemy_desc:0 "We will task our scientists to develop better ammunition, one more explosive, and adapted to the martian air. Considering Mars' atmosphere being only §YOne Percent§! as dense as Earth's we can afford to have our shells be heavier so as to have more load to fight our enemy."
 smb_human_finish_training:0 "Finalise Soldier training..."
 smb_human_finish_training_desc:0 "After months of perfecting our methods, we shall do one more push to implement our methods to the soldiers. This would result in a general increase in discipline, strength, obedience, and any other defining trait of a soldier."
 smb_human_finish_strategies:0 "...and Strategems"
 smb_human_finish_strategies_desc:0 "The months of learning and developing by Protokol: Krasnyy itself has resulted in new and more radical improvements toward our doctrine to be made. Protokol: Krasnyy will convene with the generals and would teach them the new tactics it has learned. This way, the Red Army would be unstoppable."
 smb_human_soldier_clean:0 "Keep the Army Clean"
 smb_human_soldier_clean_desc:0 "The distribution of drugs into the army is a very taboo idea, this would mean that the soldiers would run through the power of the drug instead of through their own willpower. Drugs will not, and never be a practice by the army."
 smb_human_soldier_drugs:0 ""Enhance" the army"
 smb_human_soldier_drugs_desc:0 "Although unconventional, we could distribute drugs to the soldiers in order to increase their performace in battle. Although it may decrease their discipline and effective attention, it would be worth to have a slight edge over our enemies in the battlefield through these drugs."
 
 #reign or terror
 smb_reign_of_terror:0 "The Reign of Terror"
 smb_reign_of_terror_desc:0 "Protokol: Krasnyy has seen the way past leaders of the Soviet Union ruled, they had no time for so called "freedom of expression" and "free speech," they ruled with an iron hand for the greater benefit of the people, and Protokol: Krasnyy will act like so."
 smb_great_purge:0 "The Second Great Purge"
 smb_great_purge_desc:0 "Joseph Stalin did what he had to do, the Great Purge was the only thing keeping the Soviet Union from falling to the hands of the Fifth Column, and what held it together from collapse during those dire times. Many have started thinnking of Protokol: Krasnyy's way of governing to be tyrannical, and they could potentially revolt against Protokol: Krasnyy. A §RSecond Great Purge§! is to be carried out, for the Union."
 smb_purge_army:0 "Purge the Army"
 smb_purge_army_desc:0 "§YMikhail Tukhacevsky§! was perhaps the greatest army leader before the times of the Second World War, the most awarded and decorated field marshall the Union had at its disposal. His betrayal to the Union is what caused him his life. To make sure there are no more "Mikhail Tukhacevsky's" within Vostok, the army will be pruned of ambitious and disloyal officers and personnel, and we will decide their fate."
 smb_purge_dissenters:0 "Purge the Dissenters"
 smb_purge_dissenters_desc:0 "§YLeon Trotsky§! was the main rival of Stalin at that time, the threat of him simply existing gives worry to Stalin. Just by existing, he could cause a faction of the party to follow his school of thought and potentially oust Stalin from power. Protokol: Krasnyy would not allow this to happen, any party members that showed signs of disobedience would disappear, out of sight and out of mind."
 smb_purge_scientists: "Purge the Scientists"
 smb_purge_scientists_desc:0 "§YTrofim Lysenko§! was the perfect example of an unworthy scientist. His believes were those of pseudoscience and he spent his entire life to pursue absurd goals after absurd goals. Only Protokol: Krasnyy would have "absurd" ideas, but they have purpose, unlike Lysenko's. A brain drain, to eliminate any diloyal scientists from Vostok, they would join the officers and the dissenters to hell."
 smb_1917_relived:0 "1917 Relived"
 smb_1917_relived_desc:0 "The purge is underway, and Protokol: Krasnyy is pleased with the preliminary results. During these trying times, it was as if §Y1917§! was relived, bloody but glorious. A new revolution is well on its way, with Protokol: Krasnyy leading the way of the people."
 smb_peace:0 "Peace"
 smb_peace_desc:0 "The Decree on Peace was a move made by the original revolutionaries to stop the bloodied fighting on the Eastern Front of the First World War for the benefit of the people, but the Soviet Union was humiliated this way. To adjust to our cicumstances, Protokol: Krasnyy will adapt some parts of this decree, §Yfor its ultimate plan...§!"
 smb_no_peace:0 "§LThere Will be no Peace§!"
 smb_no_peace_desc:0 "§Y...which is the elimination of peace.§! Protokol: Krasnyy calculated that what is best for the people of Vostok is that for Vostok to expand outwards. This will require the dedication of the state towards war, and claim Mars for the people. This is the only way the people will prosper."
 smb_mobilize_colony:0 "Mobilize Vostok"
 smb_mobilize_colony_desc:0 "There is only one way victory is to be achieved in this desolate rock, the Colony of Vostok must be mobilized in its entirety, its people must be willing to hold off from the abundance of food to alocate more resources to the Vostok war industry."
 smb_new_officers:0 "New officers for the Army"
 smb_new_officers_desc:0 "The Purge has left the army deprived of officers that are capable to lead and other military duties. To recover from the purge, it is necessary to promote new promising officers to fill this void."
 smb_more_men:0 "More men into the fold"
 smb_more_men_desc:0 "Be our army consist of the living, or even the dead, normal and capable human beings are still required. To fulfill Protokol: Krasnyy's promise of the §Yelimination of peace§!, more soldiers shall be conscripted into the army. The Red Army would be stronger in numbers."
 smb_state_focus:0 "The focus of the state..."
 smb_state_focus_desc:0 "Every nationstate in the world, from Earth to Mars, has their own purpose. The British Empire's was to claim the light of her sun for herself, the United States' was to spread capitalism disguised as "freedom," Nazi Germany's was to conquer the world, and so on. §YVostok's purpose...§!"
 smb_is_for_war:0 "§L...is for War!§!"
 smb_is_for_war_desc:0 "§Y...Is to wage war.§! Sure, we do fight for the true freedom of the peoples from the Bourgoise, but Protokol: Krasnyy had decided that victory in the battle for Mars is a more immediate and pressing matter than the former, for the time being."
 smb_mars_ours:0 "Mars is Ours"
 smb_mars_ours_desc:0 "Now that the purpose is highlighted, we can direct this purpose towards a cause. The cause? A Union of peoples spanning across the surface of Mars. This way, there will be more territories for humanity to expand to, free of the clawing hands of the bourgoise, a true communist Utopia."
 smb_decree_workers:0 "The Decree on Workers"
 smb_decree_workers_desc:0 "The Decree on Workers originally laid out the rights of workers for the Soviet Union during the times of Lenin. Protokol: Krasnyy will take inspiration from the original Decree on Workers and make some... §Yalterations to fit the situation we are in.§!"
 smb_restless:0 "Restless"
 smb_restless_desc:0 "To serve the revolution, everyone must dedicate their days and nights to contribute to the Soviet warmachine. §YFourteen hours a day, seven days a week.§! They shall toil for Vostok and for the revolution. No cost is too great."
 smb_zombies_to_work:0 ""Zombies" in the workforce"
 smb_zombies_to_work_desc:0 "With the use of the undead in our armed forces, we could use them with small alterations to work in the factories. Free, unpaid labor. Although his would damage efficiency, the amount of output increased would counter-balance this."
 smb_serfs:0 "Serfs"
 smb_serfs_desc:0 "Although this makes zero ideological sense, it is the decision of Protokol: Krasnyy to take a page out of the Tsar's book. The original plan was to have gulags setup for the criminals, but they serve more as a punishment than a method of production. Serfdom would give criminals the punishment they deserved, and at the same time boost the power of our industry."
 smb_drug_workforce:0 "Drug the workforce"
 smb_drug_workforce_desc:0 "The idea of using drugs to enhance the laborers' performance could not be eliminated from Krasnyy's system, and when something cannot be eliminated from its system, that means it must be a great idea of some sorts. These drugs would sustain the workers for them to be able to put in more hours in their work. The industrial might of Krasnyy will be unparalleled."
 smb_punish_rest:0 "Punish the rest"
 smb_punish_rest_desc:0 "Of the many willing to serve the Union, there are ten who are unwilling to. Severe punishments must be handed out to those whose efforts were not significant enough in the factories, Protokol: Krasnyy will figure out what these punishments are...\n\n§RPerhaps Gulags weren't a bad idea after all...§!"
 smb_land:0 "Land"
 smb_land_desc:0 "The Decree on land was Lenin's solution to the severe mismanagement of land by the Russian Empire. Its main parts were the seizure of land from the rich people of the Russian Empire and redistribute them among the peasantry. §YPerhaps Protokol: Krasnyy could twist this into the perfect vision for Vostok...§!"
 smb_roads_railways:0 "Roads and Railways"
 smb_roads_railways_desc:0 "What is important for Vostok's wellbeing as a state, is infrastructure. Without them, Vostok wouldn't be able to operate optimally. The civilian industry will be recalibrated to be able to construct the railways more efficiently."
 smb_scientists_industry:0 "Scientists in the Industry"
 smb_scientists_industry_desc:0 "As we have purged the scientists, it is fair for the replacements to be put straight to work. The industrial sector desperately needs the aid of new scientists to come up with improvements toward the industry, especially concerning the adaptation towards the martian environment. These ones are loyal, unlike the ones we have dealt with, and they will obey Protokol Krasnyy."
 smb_automated_farms:0 "Automated Farms"
 smb_automated_farms_desc:0 "In the 2020s, we have still yet discovered the proper robotics technology to automate the war industry due to the development of technology being focused on the war effort. What we have figured out however, is the technology for automated agriculture here on Mars. The land which we have seized would make great space for these new automated farms."
 smb_connect_colonies:0 "Connect the Colony"
 smb_connect_colonies_desc:0 "As we have managed to optimise and recalibrate our industry to produce materials needed to construct many railways along the colony, it is time we make good use of them.

 smb_trans_martian_railway:0 "The Trans-Martian Railway"
 smb_trans_martian_railway_desc:0 "We have gained vast swaths of land from our expansion projects, and it is about time we connect them up with infrastructure. These lands would flourish under our rule, and they would need railways for us to be able to continue spreading the glory of our state."
 smb_let_them_work:0 "Let them work..."
 smb_let_them_work_desc:0 "The lands that we have acquired opens space for a lot of factories, and factories need workers. Slowly and surely, we are depleting our workforce in the factories.
